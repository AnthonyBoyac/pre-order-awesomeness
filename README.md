# pre-order-awesomeness

Note: I haven't **git commit** throughout the semester, but all of my work is now here in one commit.

**The goal** of this project is to have a simple connection between the user, artisans, and owner. 

This one-page website is made simple for users to buy what they want and checkout. The real work is under the hood. Once a user checkouts, an invoice is sent to the user (as copy) and one to the artisan. The artisan will fill out a couple boxes inside said invoice, then submit it. Once submitted, it will arrive at the third-party's location - ours. We will then fill out the complete order from all users combined, then send that to the artisan. Finally, they will have detailed info on everything they need to complete the order, to which the third-party and the users will receive confirmation.

This software does not exist elsewhere. While some are close to ours, they're not as *hands-free* as ours is. This will allow us to put more resources elsewhere. 

Last Note: this is in trial version. I used up all the free credits, so I had to finish this project locally. I will talk to the owner about pricing beginning of next year.
